# ClearConnect

ClearConnect is a micro services platform written in Java and uses TCP for connectivity.

### No dependencies
    It has a complete technology stack to support a fully operational micro services environment.
    You don't need to import any other libraries to work with ClearConnect.
### Real-time and high-availablity
    All services transfer data updates in real-time and can be made fault-tolerant or load-balanced.
### Built-in tooling 
    There is an integrated monitoring tool that allows real-time inspection of:
        1. what services are running
        2. what data a service has
        3. what connections exist
